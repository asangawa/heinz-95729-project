# Machine Learning Research Project
Here are the codes and documents for the machine learning research project. 
The purpose of the research is to make sure the feature importance of algorithms for inferring the result; 

Our project URL is as follows:
https://github.com/asangawa/heinz-95729-project/new/main/ml-research

## Tutrial
A tutorial is here:

Traditional machine learning models and the neural network model are implemented in Jupyter notebooks. 
Please refer to the corresponding notebooks.
  * **Traditional Machine Learning**: 01_KNN_DT_RF_V2.ipynb
  * **Neural Network**: 02_NeuralNetwork_CervicalCancerClassification_DI.ipynb

Jupyter notebook url is here:
https://jupyter.org/

We use the code implemented by the **Tetrad project** in the causal inference part. 
The Tetrad project licenses all the codes relevant to the causal inference part. 
All licensing of the causal AI portion is subject to the stipulations of the Tedrad project. 
**Please refer to the documents and tutorials before using them. **

Tetrad GitHub url is here:

Also, we use the Java environment to work the causal inference code tetrad-gui-7.1.0-launch.jar. 
**If you use this .jar file, please make sure you already install Java.**
